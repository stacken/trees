Hi to all new KTH students!

On Thursday next week, the Stacken Computer Club will have its first get-together for the year. At 19:15 we will meet at the club room at floor 2 in the Q building, where we hang out, talk computers and hack away at our projects. There will likely be drinks and snacks! We usually stick around until midnight, but everyone are of course free to come and go as they like. (Remember that unless you are taking courses at the Q building at the main KTH campus, you may need help to get into the building after 7 pm. See the below paragraph about how to get in touch with us)

If you want to get in touch with us outside of a thursday night, we have gathered all of our communication channels here: https://www.stacken.kth.se/en/forum/

After the first get-together, we will also host lectures in various programming languages and techniques during the fall semester. No specific topics have been planned as of yet, but we will send out e-mails when we have decided this further!

At www.stacken.kth.se/en/, you can find info about earlier lectures, a map to the club room and lots of other things!

We hope to see you soon, and good luck with your studies at KTH! :D
